Working with Amazing Prime Video: Extract, Transform, and Load.


This has been, by far, the most difficult module for me to date. The details of this challenge were amazing. Cleaning the data, determining the apropriate columns, data type and syntax were all together a robust workout. I'm exhausted. And I wasn't able to duplicate the final product that I was able to achieve during the week. 


One particular issue i encountered, as did many others, was the size of the ratings.csv. I zipped the csv file and it was still too large to upload. I lewarned a tremendous lesson of going line by line through code and commenting out lines of code to make sure everything is spelled correctly, punctuated appropriately and indented in the correct way. A great reminder.

The purpose of this module was too create a database that could be used for a hackathon provided by Amazing Prime Video. there were three sources of data and each source had it's own challenges when ETL practices were applied.
